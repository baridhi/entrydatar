\title{Tidying the dataset for regression use (or merge): operate year by year to keep memory to manageable levels.}
\usage{
tidy_qcew_year(dt, frequency = "all", industry = "naics",
  verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dt}{input dataset from get_qcew_cut}

\item{frequency}{download either quarterly, monthly or all data}

\item{industry}{download naics or sic data}

\item{verbose}{do we print the years to see how fast we are going}
}
\value{
data.table dt_res
}
\description{
Tidying the dataset for regression use (or merge): operate year by year to keep memory to manageable levels.
}
\note{
returns a data.table file that is formatted according to tidy standard
  typically this will be year x sub_year (quarter or month) x size x own_code x industry
  the file can be aggregated as such
  I do not download all the information (some location quotients and taxes are forgotten)
